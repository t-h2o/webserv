=== Create a clang image

____
2023.03.10 : Create a docker image for formating the source files.
____

I tried with an `alpine` image, the problem was that the `clang` package wasn't up of date. Finally, I used an `archlinux` image.

Create a `docker` folder and `clang` as a subfolder and its own `Makefile` and `Dockerfile`

How use it ?

. go into `docker/clang`
. execute `make`
. back to the root of the project
. execute `make formatdocker`
